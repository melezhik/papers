# Fast monitoring scripts development

# Friday morning

Are you smart smart web developer using Mojolicious or Dancer2 or Kelp ?
Sure, Yes you are! ;-) You have just finished your another web application ready to get deployed
and waited with impatience by your customers. All your t/ are fine, you for sure use Plack::Test
or familar tool to tests your application not only internal but external way. Everything is going to be 
fine, even though it's friday today and is not probaly good time to make a release, but you
anxious to see the results and get users input, so you are comming to John - your devops
specialst and pointig him a git URL where your sourcde code lives so he could start the deploy procedure ...


... But, yes, there are some "buts". John kindly asking you to provides some monitoring
capabilites for your freshly baked application, so he could make it sure it won't break
on weekend without letting anybody know ...


# What should you do ?

'Ahh, monitoring John, yes, sure' thoughts passing in your mind ...'  - Well John, you could try a curl or check_http or
something else  and wtite your own bash script to do the things. It's easy for sure, you only take care about 
cookies get sent back upon successful authentication, you know curl "knows" cookies, you know cookie?
Also there database connection check you probably have to ensure, you know this a route called GET /database-info ...
Saying all these phraases you look at John and see him unhappy, afterthe moment you will be knowing why. Ahh,
Alex ( this your name ) -  "Routes, cookies, authentication ... what your are talking about ? Sorry, I am pretty swamped by ouher 
dutes, you know a couple web applications comming from next departemnt needs to get deployed soon, sorry, really sorry
can't create a monitoring right now, what if we postpone the deployement till Monaday, when we have for sure some
monitoring checks for your application? Now it's time to be unhappy for you!
